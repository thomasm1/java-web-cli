DevOps

What is DevOps?

	- Methodology that combines Development (writing code)
	and Operations (maintaining infrastructure to merge the code)

	- Goal is to more efficiently produce higher quality code.


CI/CD/CD

- Continuous Integration
	- the process of continually checking code into a
	central repository and checking if it integrates into
	the code base.
		- Make changes to code, push to repo (GitHub), automated building
		- Example: Jenkins, Travis

- Continuous Delivery
	- the ability to have code ready for production in a way
	that is often automated. Release to customer/production is
	often ready at the press of a button.
		- This means tests have passed and is ready to go.

- Continuous Deployment
	- is similar to Continuous Delivery, except code is constantly
	being deployed to the user. Get feedback even faster.


DevOps Tools

- Pipeline
	- is an automated set of processes that use tools
	to compile, test, and deploy code for software features.

- Linux
	- Not so super popular for personal desktop, OS.
	- Open source, can be adpated for specific needs
	- Free
	- Lightweight

- Tomcat
	- web container, environment that we are going to
	deploy our packages into.

- Maven
	- Maven goals:
	   - clean, validate, test, package, verify,
	   install, deploy.

- Jenkins
	- Continuous Integration Tool
	- Open source automation server
	- build automation tool; it provides support for
	automating the process of building and deploying projects.
	- Allows us to achieve CI/CD/CD
	- Can include various plugins to integrate with
	other technologies.



- Sonar
	- static code analysis
	- Code quality analysis tools which expose "code smells", 
	vulnerabilities, and bugs.
		- Code smell: this is code that isn't wrong per se, just bad.

	- SonarQube
	  - Central Server which processes full analyses, which build into
	    your pipeline.

	- SonarCloud
	  - Cloud based system where you can configure and view the
	    application's code analysis on the cloud.

	- SonarLint
	  - In the IDE, portions of code will be underlined
	 if there is a perceived issue with it.


- Git(Hub)
	- Git - version control tool




Amazon Web Services - AWS

Infrastructure
	- IT Infrastructure
	   - Hardware, software network resources and services
	required for existence, operation, and management
	of an enterprise IT environment.
	
	- Cloud Computing
	   - Accessing IT infrastructure over the internet
	   - Nothing is stored locally except interfaces
	to access them.


	- RDS - Relational Database Service
	   - Allows us to store a database remotely. As well
	as manipulate it.

	- Simple Storage Service (S3)
	   - Highly scalable data storage
	   - Static web host
	   - Only pay what you use
	   - High durability (11 9s -> 99.999999999%) and
	availability.


	- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
	   - Virtual Server
