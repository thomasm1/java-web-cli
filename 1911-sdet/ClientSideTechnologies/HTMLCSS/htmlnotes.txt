HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

It is not a programming Language.
(I will disown you if you say it is a programming language)

The purpose of HTML is display information and content to a web page.

the HTML file extension (.html) tells the browser to interpret
and parse the characters to create a web page.

Elements - core building block of an HTML page.
They define the structure.
They can be nested.


<h1>Some Header</h1>
Some sub Category

    - Generally very bad practice to overlap or not close elements.
    - Browsers tend to be very fault tolerant.

    <h1><b>Some Header</b></h1>

Attributes - adjectives/properties to your elements.
They have a key-value relationship.

<h1 id='header1'>Value of the Element</h1>

Element Types

Block Elements - Form a large structure to contain
other elements.
    - Creates a new line by default.

    - <h1>, <html>, <body>, <head>, <table>,
    <form>, <div>

Inline Elements - Contain data or other inline elements
    - <button>, <input>, <span>, <textarea>, <a>

---------------------------------

Document Object Model (DOM)

    - Represents the document structure as nodes and
    objects.
    - we can manipulat this structure using JavaScript.
    - You reference the DOM with the 'document' object.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

    - Helps display HTML elements
    - Separate design from development. Also reusable.

    - Makes webpages more human accessible and user friendly.


There are three ways to implement CSS:

Inline - inside the HTML element.

    <h1 style="color: pink">Hello</h1>

Internal - With <style> in the <head>

External - Abstracted into a separate style sheeet.
         - Referenced in the <head> of the HTML file.


Cascade Algorithm - This is an algorithm for determining
the final properties of elements. Properties *cascade*
from the outermost locations to innermost.

External -> Internal -> Inline
