DOM - Document Object Model

    - This is the reason JavaScript was created
    - makes web pages dynamic
    
    - It is a way to present an HTML page as a series
    of connected nodes.


Event - 
    - Event is a user action or something that occurs on
    the page.
    - Ex: click, mouseover, load


Event listeners / handlers
    - It will listen for an event to occur on a specific
    element and it 'fires' a function.
    - This function is called an action.
    - This is also a callback function.


2 steps to creating an event listener.

    //get the element
    1. let element = document.getElementById("myId");
    2. element.addEventListener(event, action, capture?);
        --element.addEventListener(event, action);
    

-----------------------------


Bubbling - is when an event handler executes from the innermost
element to the outermost element. This is the default for
'almost all' browsers.

Capturing - is when an event handler executes from the 
outermost element to the innermost element.
