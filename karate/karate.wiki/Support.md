Karate has a [dedicated tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/karate). This is the best place to ask general and "how to" questions.

If you have found a bug, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/intuit/karate/issues) on the project issue tracker. If you don't provide enough information for the developers to understand or replicate the issue, you will be asked to follow the process here: [How to Submit an Issue](https://github.com/intuit/karate/wiki/How-to-Submit-an-Issue).

To request an invite to the slack channel, please send an e-mail to: ptrthomas AT gmail DOT com - and you *must* include a link to a question you have posted on any of the above channels. Apologies for the extra step, but this is needed to reduce spam.
